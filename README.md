# Project-4-Nod-Analytics-Bootcamp
The project was on the topic of clustering in the context of machine learning.

More specifically we were instructed to analyze the clusters the machine identified and argue for why those clusters exists. In the case of this project, that used data from kickstarter project, I concluded that the clusters belonged to one of three categories:

* High profile projects (extremely succesful and popular)
* Overly Ambitious projects (projects with very high funding goals and low amount of backers. Some projects tend to be jokes)
* The not-so-interesting (basically the rest)
